# Theme
- In our game ESCAPE, the theme of "nearby in space, but distant in time" was addressed in the main gameâ€™s design from creating a timeless setting that creates an airy environment. The environment in the game feels like there is nothing but space. There is no time setting in the game, which makes it tie in to the theme
